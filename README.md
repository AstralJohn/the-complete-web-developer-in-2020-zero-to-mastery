<h1>Update 5/15/18</h1>
<p>I will be skipping over, well.... A lot of the beginning JavaScript for 2 reasons.</p>
  <ol>
<li>I am taking 2 very in depth courses on JavaScript that go way beyond this course. And have already taken courses in the past that cover JavaScript better than Andrei could (in my opinion)</li>
    <li>Because of the first reason, relearning these basics are mind numbingly painful to go through again, and again for every "beginner to mastery" course I have.</li>
</ol>
<h2>If you have trouble with JavaScript, I can personally mentor you through it as it is my favorite language to learn and teach. Just shoot me a message on Discord and I would be more than happy to help</h2>

<h2>The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery</h2>

<p>
In this repository, I will upload any and all assignments that I would have to do in the course.
This is more of just "proof" that I have done the work to earn my certification in the course.
