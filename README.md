In this repository, I will upload all the major projects that I would have to do in the course.
This is more of just "proof" that I have done the work to earn my certification in the course.

<h4>Good News! Update 12/9/18</h4>

<h4>Update 6/2/18</h4>
<p>I hate to say this but I'm really dissapointed with this course. There is a ton of information to learn which is good! But the way it is taught is horrible in my opinion. The reason I can say this is because I have over 50 web development Udemy course (yup over 50) and I found the teaching style in this course was not even close to being on par with the other instructors. I just want to keep this honest, instead of lying to people and saying "This is such a good course because of all the reviews and people taking it!". I will periodically come back to this course and upload all the "big projects" on this repository. Although I will be skipping over Andrei's small exercises, I will include the Udemy courses I believe are <strong>way much better</strong> than this one in terms of teaching. As of now, I have substituted all of Andrei's JavaScript with the following Udemy course below. It covers all of the topic Andrei touches but is by far, better taught in my opinion.</p>
