<h4>Quick Update 5/17/18</h4>
<h6>I personally didn't like the way Andrei teaches JavaScript, and I also wanted to learn ES6, so I am taking an entire seperate course on JavaScript called 'The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp (2018). <br> I actually really like the teaching style in this course and uploaded all the files and exercises we did from the very basics (beginning) on a seperate Repository called "js-bootcamp" This is just a personal preferance on teaching styles. I am breezing through the other course and will continue to upload projects on Andrei's course here very soon! <br> <strong>PS. I will be focusing on Andrei's bigger projects first, and then come back to create and commit all files from his JavaScript section. As of now I am half way done my other JavaScript course. I am excited to come back and start coding the projects on this one as soon as possible!</strong></h6>

<h1>Update 5/15/18</h1>
<p>I will be skipping over, well.... A lot of the beginning JavaScript for 2 reasons.</p>
  <ol>
<li>I am taking 2 very in depth courses on JavaScript that go way beyond this course. And have already taken courses in the past that cover JavaScript better than Andrei could (in my opinion)</li>
    <li>Because of the first reason, relearning these basics are mind numbingly painful to go through again, and again for every "beginner to mastery" course I have.</li>
</ol>

<h2>If you have trouble with JavaScript, I can personally mentor you through it as it is my favorite language to learn and teach. Just shoot me a message on Discord and I would be more than happy to help</h2>
<h3>PS. If I actually <em>do</em> happen to commit a JavaScript exercise from Andrei's course on here, please note that it is probably a <strong><em>VERY</em></strong> good thing to take note of, and that you should know how to do it on your own beforehand, as it would probably be good practice for a beginner developer. I know I post only solutions on this repository but please refrain from using it as a crutch, but more of as a way to <strong>compare solutions</strong>. This is really important as it not only helps you think critically, but also really helps you improve and grow as a developer</h3>
